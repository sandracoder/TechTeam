### Project Description
Our project aims to develop a Chrome extension that protects users from falling victim to fake websites offering fraudulent rewards or gifts. These websites, often spread via messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, or social media platforms, lure users with false promises and can lead to data theft or scams. We plan to alert the users if they come by a fake website through our extension.

### The Problem statement
Malicious websites are frequently shared via popular messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, often disguised as "free gifts" or "rewards." These fraudulent sites trick users, leading to potential financial loss, identity theft, and malware infections. Despite available security tools, many users are unaware of these threats in real-time.

### The Solution
The NoCap extension will:

*Detect Fake Links: Use Google Safe Browsing API to identify harmful websites in real-time.

*Analyze Content Patterns: Scan websites for phishing patterns, such as overly capitalized comments, generic usernames, or common scam phrases like ‚ÄúI got the gift today.‚Äù

*Warn Users: Display a warning when users visit suspected malicious websites, notifying them with messages like:
"This website is flagged as potentially fake or harmful. Proceed with caution or return to safety."

*Indicate Safe Sites: Provide reassurance for legitimate websites with a ‚ÄúSafe Website‚Äù label
